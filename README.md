# Computer Vision Project

*Title: Chicken and Turkey Detection System*  
*Adriza Rafly Azlami - 2155301006*

## Background
Computer Vision technology is now widely used in various fields, including animal husbandry. One of its applications is the automatic detection of livestock through images or cameras. This project aims to build a simple system that can detect chickens using the Augmented Bounding method, with the results being the label "chicken" and a level of confidence (confidence score). This system does not perform further training or learning, but only recognizes chickens from images or cameras directly.

## Objective
- Developing a simple Computer Vision-based system that can automatically detect chicken objects using the Augmented Bounding method.
- Displaying the "chicken" label along with the level of confidence of the detection results.
- Accepting input in the form of real-time images or videos from the camera.
- Integrating this detection system into an Android application.

## Dataset Used
- Dataset: “Chicken Detection and Tracking 2” by Mohamed Traore (from Roboflow).
- Focus: dataset for chicken.

## Implementation Process
1. Dataset and Model Preparation
2. Implementation of Detection with Augmented Bounding
3. Input Image and Live Camera Testing
4. Integration into Android
